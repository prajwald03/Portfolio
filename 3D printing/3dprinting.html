    <h2>Ultimaker Cura Software</h2>
    Day 1 Activity Day 1 Activity
    Ultimaker Cura is a free, open-source software widely used for slicing 3D models and preparing them for 3D printing. Developed by Ultimaker, a prominent manufacturer of 3D printers, Cura supports a wide range of 3D printers, not just Ultimaker machines. Here's a brief overview of its features:
    Slicing: Cura takes 3D models in STL, OBJ, or other formats and slices them into thin horizontal layers, generating the toolpaths that the 3D printer will follow.
    Customization: Users can customize print settings such as layer height, infill density, print speed, and support structures to achieve the desired print quality and properties.
    Preview: Cura provides a visual preview of the sliced model, allowing users to inspect each layer and identify potential issues before printing.
    Multiple Printer Support: While Ultimaker Cura is developed by Ultimaker, it supports a wide range of 3D printers from various manufacturers, making it a versatile option for many users.
    Plugin System: Cura features a plugin system that allows users to extend its functionality with additional features and tools.
    Community and Updates: Ultimaker Cura benefits from an active user community, which contributes to its ongoing development and improvement. Regular updates ensure that the software stays current with the latest advancements in 3D printing technology.
    Overall, Ultimaker Cura is a powerful, user-friendly tool that simplifies the process of preparing 3D models for printing, making it accessible to beginners while offering advanced features for experienced users.

    <h2>ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES OF 3D PRINTING</h2>
<h3>ADVANTAGES</h3>
We can print even complex object design using 3D printer.
Create prototype in couple of hours which increase the designing process speed.<br>
Basic material used for 3D printing is plastics thus the object printed by this one are much lighter than traditional one.<br>
Reduces the quantity of waste materials created during the production process.<br>


<h3>DISADVANTAGES</h3>
 Since the dimensions integrated into 3D printers is relatively small, which restricting the part sizes .<br>
 Though its new technology it offen reqquires trial and error method when creating parts on a 3D printer.<br>
 Very few materials are available for printing in 3D printing technology.<br>

<p>In 3D printing, various types of support are often required to ensure the successful fabrication of complex geometries and overhangs. Here are some common types of support used in 3D printing:

♦ Overhang support:This is the most common type of support used in 3D printing. It provides temporary structural support for overhanging features of the model during printing. Overhang support is typically automatically generated by slicing software based on a predefined angle threshold.<br>

♦ Bridging support: Bridging support is used to support horizontal spans or bridges between two points in the model. It prevents sagging or collapsing of these unsupported sections during printing.<br>

♦ Raft support: A raft is a flat base layer that is printed underneath the object being printed. It provides better adhesion to the build platform and helps to prevent warping of the model during printing. Raft support is especially useful for models with small contact areas or those prone to warping.<br>

♦ Tree support: Tree support structures are designed to minimize material usage and post-processing efforts. They branch out from the build platform to support overhanging features of the model. Tree supports are often more efficient and consume less material compared to traditional linear supports.<br>
